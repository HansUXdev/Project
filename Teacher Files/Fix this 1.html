        <strong>What <i> is</i> Lopem Ipsum?</strong>
    </h2>

    <p><br>
        <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
        essentially unchanged. <em>It was popularised in the 1960s</em> with the release 
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions 
        of Lorem Ipsum.
